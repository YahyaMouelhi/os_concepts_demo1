                <p>Different devices (Phones , Computers , Smart Watches etc..) are programmed to do a certain job , and they rquire hardwares that function together following 
                    different algorithms and stages (We will talk deeply about them later) and each hardware have its own purpose and rules ...  </p>
                <img src="hardwares.jpeg" alt="">
                <h4>Examples of essential hardwares :</h4>

                    <li>
                        <h4>RAM :</h4>
                        <p>
                            What Is RAM? RAM is a common computing acronym that stands for random-access memory. Sometimes it's 
                            called PC memory or just memory. In essence, RAM is your computer or laptop's short-term memory. It's 
                            where the data is stored that your computer processor needs to run your applications and open your files.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>CPU :</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” 
                            The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry 
                            that runs the machine's operating system and apps.</p>
                        <img src="cpu.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>HDD :</h4>
                        <p>A computer hard drive (or a hard disk or HDD) is one kind of technology that stores the operating system, applications, 
                            and data files such a documents, pictures and music that your computer uses. The rest of the components in your computer work 
                            together to show you the applications and files stored on your hard drive.</p>

                        <h4>GPU :</h4>
                        <p>
                            The graphics processing unit (GPU) in your device helps handle graphics-related work like graphics, effects, and videos.
                             Learn about the different types of GPUs and find the one that meets your needs.
                             Integrated GPUs are built into your PC's motherboard, allowing laptops to be thin, lightweight, and power-efficient.</p>

                        <h4>Mother Board :</h4>
                        <p>The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other.
                            Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality
                            is necessary for a computer to work well.</p>

                        <p>A process moves from wait state to suspend wait state if a process with higher priority has to be executed but the main memory is full. 
                            Moving a process with lower priority from wait state to suspend wait state creates a room for higher priority process in the ready state.</p>

                <h3>What is PCB ?</h3>
                <p>
                    Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it.
                     The process control block is also known as a task control block, entry of the process table, etc.
                     It is very important for process management as the data structuring for processes is done in terms of the PCB.</p>
                <p>Attributes of process :</p>
                <img src="pcb.png" alt="">
                <hr>
                <h3>What is a context ?</h3>
                <p>In computer science, a task context is the minimal set of data used by a task that must be saved
                    to allow a task to be interrupted, and later continued from the same point.</p>
                <p>The context of a process includes its address space, stack space, virtual address space, register set 
                    image (e.g. Program Counter (PC), Stack Pointer (SP), Instruction Register (IR), Program Status Word 
                    (PSW) and other general processor registers), updating profiling or accounting information, making a snapshot image ...</p>
                <h4>Sounds like too much information ? Dont worry i just mentioned them and you can either ignore them or just at least know them .</h4>
                <hr>
                <h3>We will talk about Context Switching & Context Swapping ! </h3>
                <h4>Context Switching :</h4>
                <p>context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be
                    restored and resume execution at a later point, and then restoring a different, previously saved, state. And it happens between <strong>RAM</strong> and <strong>CPU</strong> .</p>
                <h4>Context Swapping :</h4>
                <p>
                    Context Switching involves storing the context or state of a process so that it can be reloaded when 
                    required and execution can be resumed from the same point as 
                    earlier. This is a feature of a multitasking operating system and allows a single CPU to be shared by multiple processes.And it happens between <strong>RAM</strong> and <strong>HDD</strong> .</p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Long Term Scheduler : </h3>
                <p>Long-term scheduling is performed when a new process is created.
                    This is a decision whether to add a new process to the set of processes 
                    that are currently active.Happens between RAM and HDD.</p>
                <h3>Short Term Scheduler : </h3>
                <p>Short-term scheduling involves selecting one of the processes from the ready queue and scheduling them for execution. 
                    This is done by the short-term scheduler. A scheduling algorithm is used to decide which process will be scheduled for 
                    execution next by the short-term scheduler.Happens between RAM and CPU.</p>
                <h3>Medium Term Scheduler : </h3>
                <p>Medium-term scheduling is a part of the swapping function. This is a decision whether to add a process to those 
                    that are at least partially in main memory and therefore available for execution.
                    Short-term scheduling is the actual decision of which ready process to execute next.Also between RAM and HDD.</p>
